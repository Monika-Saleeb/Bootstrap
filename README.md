# Bootstrap
This was the work from the 4 weeks I spent on the course, "Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4", from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
on Coursera. 
The page you see before you was done through HTML, Bootstrap4, jQuery, SASS and Node.js 
Amazing course, highly recomment to those looking into Front-End web Development!
